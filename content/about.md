Notes informed by a life spent at the periphery but in spitting distance from the center:
Ann Arbor, Budapest, Cambridge. Lived under various isms, through revolutions,
experienced freedom and the pressure to conform. I am interested in how people
can create better systems and how good systems can make better people. To understand
why the periphery is important, read [this article](/articles/how-the-provinces-conquer/).
