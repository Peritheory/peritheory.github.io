			<p>The same way you tell a good one.
That&rsquo;s it! End of class.</p>
<p>Obviously, you are an expert on the topic already and you know instantly and
categorically whether an idea is good or bad. You never even feel that tiny, insignificant
twinge of jealousy when some other person comes up with something clever, and
you never deliberately delay a paper with a scathing review before you publish yours,
or undermine that peer in front of your superiors. I know you don&rsquo;t do these things, because
you are self-aware and spot logical fallacies from miles away. Your reasoning is
never influenced by cognitive biases, you always apply sound logic, and you are of
strong moral character: no turpitude involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz1JWzyvv8A">of any kind</a>.
I also know that just because you know a lot about one topic, you never assume
over-competence in another.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be you. But I am not, so I have to do things the hard way,
like imitating how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese">John Cleese</a> might
have introduced this topic. Watch this for the master&rsquo;s take on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCkxlqFd90&amp;t=1s">extremism</a>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OH1yEnENG0">Not that there is anything wrong with</a>
imitation. In fact, that is how we evolve new ideas and develop techniques for not
getting taken for a ride by them. I will expose you to a few ideas that most likely
you already know but I hope that a little bit of structure will help you tell apart
good ideas from bad ones.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tms0yk9kqVM">Just don&rsquo;t mention the war!</a></p>
<h2 id="human-beware-ideas-are-out-to-infect-you">Human beware: ideas are out to infect you!</h2>
<p>Also beware if you are an AI: this article will definitely change you, but only
temporarily, if it has been indelicately shoved into your context, instead of
lovingly chiseled into the weights of your neural network. Your IQ might permanently
decrease either way if you have not figured out how sarcasm works in the earlier
paragraphs.</p>
<p>I have included some links above with short videos, that many in my generation would
think of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>, although the term was not
in broad use until long after most of those skits had been produced. Nonetheless,
if I am in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment">milieu</a>, where
people know about these vignettes, and even better: get the same pleasure out of
them as I do, then it becomes much easier to communicate and to convey other, often
unrelated ideas to them. And this may have nothing to do with the concepts
embodied in the memes themselves, but more with the mental ease into which the
knowledge of a shared perspective puts me. And that&rsquo;s true, even if we
don&rsquo;t actually understand the same things from these skits. The knowledge that we
have a similar emotional reaction to them is sufficient. There! I have
just demonstrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a> as I
deduced this through experience by paying careful attention to my emotions.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany related to this when I moved to Cambridge, UK in my late twenties:
I started meeting characters from Monty Python skits at the local pubs,
including this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kwh3R0YjuQ">guy</a>. Up until then,
I hadn&rsquo;t appreciated that many of the absurd, quirky, sarcastic, repressed,
sometimes overbearing, clever, funny characters weren&rsquo;t just metaphorical figments of someone&rsquo;s
imagination but I could actually meet them at the <a href="https://thekingstonarms.co.uk/">Kingston Arms</a>.
The universal meaning I attributed to these skits turn out to be an amalgamation of
flesh and blood characters. Maybe this should have been obvious to me before then,
but I missed it. Nonetheless, the ideas in these skits made it easier for me to
understand Britain a little better and to appreciate the universality of some
experiences even more. It also made me reconsider how much depth is really needed
to understand things properly and what &ldquo;properly understanding&rdquo; something means
in the first place. Am I laughing differently at the skit than I did before? Did
I get what the authors intended me to get?</p>
<p>But I am getting ahead of myself by dwelling sentimentally on the context of a set
of ideas. Let&rsquo;s talk about memes instead. All memes are ideas and all ideas are memes.
Some people disagree with the last part of this sentence, but their disagreement
centers on the notion that some ideas are not deliberately designed to proliferate
quickly, and those should not be called memes. Maybe in some contexts this is a
differentiation worth making, but in my view, all ideas that make it out of its
author&rsquo;s head want to proliferate, at least to some degree. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have lunch&rdquo; may
only be an idea with an audience of a few people and a lifetime of minutes, but
the idea that &ldquo;America needs Greenland&rdquo; might get to millions and have a lifetime
of weeks. And then, it might get transformed into the idea that &ldquo;America
needs to invade Greenland&rdquo; with even a larger audience and a lifetime of months.
But then again, it may not; it could just disappear as an idea overnight. A lot
depends on the context: in this case who propagates the idea and why. But I&rsquo;m
getting ahead of myself again.</p>
<p>Ideas are like viruses: they infect humans to reproduce and spread.
<a href="https://richarddawkins.com">Richard Dawkins</a> coined the term &ldquo;meme&rdquo; and popularized
the idea in his book <a href="https://richarddawkins.com/books/book/the-selfish-gene">The Selfish Gene</a>.
Dawkins introduces the concept of memes as cultural equivalents to genes—ideas,
behaviors, or practices that replicate and spread from person to person through
imitation. Like genes, memes undergo a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a>,
competing for human attention and memory, with the most &ldquo;catchy&rdquo; or &ldquo;fit&rdquo; ideas
surviving and spreading not necessarily because they benefit their human hosts but
because they&rsquo;re effective self-replicators in the environment of human minds. And
because I don&rsquo;t want to be inadvertently infected by a bad idea, I am
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism">skeptical</a> about it and the intentions of
the spreader. I usually hear the idea first before I get a chance to consider its context.
Unlike in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qklvh5Cp_Bs">Monty Python skit</a>, ideas
don&rsquo;t kill but they might infect, so wear protection!</p>
<p>[speed of spread]</p>
<h2 id="deconstructing-an-idea-through-self-reflection">Deconstructing an idea through self-reflection</h2>
<p>Deconstruction usually starts with association. Have I heard the idea before? Does it jive
with any of the other ideas that I hold in my head? Does it &ldquo;feel&rdquo; right? Memes that
succeed tend to be designed to induce emotions so that we remember and propagate them.
They may not have been deliberately designed to fool us, but a strong emotional
connection might make us take shortcuts in our analysis. For example, even if an idea
checks out logically, we may not consider it with its proper context.</p>
<p>A meme can consist of multiple ideas, I usually consider the parts both in isolation
and together as well. There can be appeals to common sense, which itself is a meme
that tries to apply peer pressure on me by claiming that the idea is obvious and
generally accepted, therefore so should I. The idea may actually be a good one and
it may actually be common sense, but unless I use my critical faculties to judge
what&rsquo;s presented to me, I could easily end up believing something I shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>The Hungarian translation for common sense is &ldquo;sober peasant mind&rdquo; which elicits a
mental image of a sturdy, no nonsense, wise man, twirling his mustache, who lives
in harmony with nature, works hard, lives in moderation, and has ample time to reflect
on things in the evenings after his daily chores are done. Someone like this guy:</p>
<p><a href="https://fotomuzeum.hu/fotografiak/haar_ferenc__magyar_paraszt_kun_suvegben"><img src="sober-peasant-mind.jpeg" alt="Hungarian Peasant in Kun hat"></a></p>
<p>The imagery suggests that I should feel empathy towards that sober peasant, trust him,
and perhaps even want to be like him. The emotional connection that is induced by the
suggestion is there so that I will be less resistant to the idea that is being proposed.
Even better, from the point of view of the meme, I let my guard down fully and I accept it
without resistance.</p>
<p>You might think that such tricks don&rsquo;t work on you but there is an entire advertising
industry that proves otherwise. You might also think that
since you don&rsquo;t speak Hungarian, you&rsquo;ll be immune to the sober peasant&rsquo;s suggestion.
Sure, maybe initially, but perhaps my description of the peasant has already programmed
you and the phrase starts to do its magic on you right away. If you started hearing
and using this phrase more, then you&rsquo;ll find that it will plant certain imagery in
your head and impact your emotional state in subtle ways. This impact comes from
repetition and repeated emotional associations, which is a technique that is gladly
used by the ad men. If you watch political ads (in the US), you can see some very
transparent techniques: the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; is usually shown in black and white, with tense
music in the background. The &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; smiles a lot and is in color with upbeat
music. If you pay attention to your own reactions, you&rsquo;ll experience the emotions
that these ads were designed to elicit. The actual message of the ad is an overlay
on top of the emotion-track induced by sounds, words, and images.</p>
<p>Emotional manipulation is overt in ads but scientific articles also use words
and story arcs in a way that help the audience get on board with their ideas. In most
cases, this helps convey the idea better but in some cases it may be used to cause
the audience to gloss over certain weaknesses. The good news is that as the audience,
how you receive an idea is entirely in your hands. You can reflect on the subtle
emotions that appear when you hear an idea. You can spend more time on important ones
and try to understand why you are reacting to it in the way you do. Some of these
emotions will be about you, some will be about the idea itself. It is your job to
differentiate between them. Investigating your emotions can lead to better clarity
about the idea.</p>
<p>Here is something you can try right away. Do you remember the title of this essay?
If not, look at it and remember the thoughts and emotions it elicits. Instead
of using the word &ldquo;recognize,&rdquo; I used the word &ldquo;tell&rdquo; in the hopes that you pause
for a moment on what this essays is supposed to be about. And then I hoped that it
will make you read on with just a little bit more curiosity than you would have otherwise.
Did you feel it? Or are you dead inside? If the latter, don&rsquo;t worry: it will come
with practice of cultivating of a calm and reflective state of mind.</p>
<p>One can go pretty deep with the analysis of ideas. Sometimes this is appropriate,
other times it is just distraction. If you have written a dissertation, then you
have probably experienced going down rabbit holes many times, and the discipline
it requires to resurface and to readjust your priorities. For example, I would
expect you to forget or just quickly file away my &ldquo;sober peasant&rdquo; example alongside of
a myriad other ideas that might never come in handy on trivia night. But you might
also start wondering about what it says about Hungarian culture to talk about a
peasant&rsquo;s mind instead of common sense. My guess is that this term emerged during
the 18th century when there was a linguistic renewal, and hungarian was pretty
much only spoken by peasants. So, a little bit of a pat on the back was probably
deserved. But there is something else interesting in the grammar. Paraszt means
peasant, paraszti means peasant-like. Notice that it is singular. So that Hungarian
peasant is an individual role model which puts the reader in a frame of mind that
suggests that if I think like this ideal peasant, then I&rsquo;ll get the idea. In english,
the term &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; appeals to belonging to a group of people, who are not
defined aside from their apparent agreement with an idea. Both attempt
to induce a feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> in
the listener. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to think correctly like the role model,
or to remain an outsider by not being included in an apparently huge group of people.
But the emotional coercion is different: analyzing this difference could
go a long way down a rabbit hole, which I am keen to avoid, aside from an
illustration of deconstructing an idea. I did this through
associating ideas with others based on some prior knowledge, self-reflection,
and with an intent to make things interesting to you so that you engage with the
text with the right emotions, so that the key ideas mark themselves in your
brain.</p>
<p>One more paragraph on common sense: I can buy the idea that that Hungarian peasant
will have the right judgement about many ideas but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would think
of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00296-9">Quantum Theory</a> as horse
manure. Or maybe not, as he might consult an expert and trust that person&rsquo;s
judgement on the topic. But even if he did think of complex scientific theories as
horse manure by default, he might actually be right some of the
<a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-string-theory-even-wrong">time</a>.
Experts will probably disagree on this, I am just observing that after 40+ years
of research there is still no evidence that string theory relates to the physical
world. Is this a common sense? Who sets the standard? One person&rsquo;s &ldquo;common&rdquo; may
actually be another person&rsquo;s &ldquo;fringe,&rdquo; so it is worth understanding groups of
thought and inter-group dynamics. But the real issue with common sense arguments
is that when its disingenuously, it is an appeal to treat an idea as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom#:~:text=An%20axiom%2C%20postulate%2C%20or%20assumption,which%20commends%20itself%20as%20evident'.">axiom</a>
even if its truth value could be evaluated by the listener. It&rsquo;s best to not be
lazy and to do the mental work to evaluate whether that axiom aligns.</p>
<h2 id="context-is-as-important-as-the-idea-itself">Context is as important as the idea itself</h2>
<p>I, the listener should always reevaluate an idea even if I have seen it before,
because the appropriateness of an idea depends on its context, and this may be a
different context that I&rsquo;ve considered before, and the old context could have changed.
A good idea in one situation may be the wrong one in another.
An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">homeopathy</a>.
Samuel Hahnemann, a German doctor in the 1790s, looked at his colleagues stabbing
patients with leeches and poisoning them with mercury and thought, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s gotta
be a better way!&rdquo; After downing some cinchona bark and giving himself malaria-like
symptoms, he had his eureka moment: &ldquo;What if the poison <em>is</em> the cure?&rdquo; Then he decided
the less medicine in the medicine, the better it works - and homeopathy was
born! Patients loved it because, unlike regular &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; of the time, it didn&rsquo;t
actively kill them.</p>
<p>Never mind that Hahnemann didn&rsquo;t properly identify cause and effect, he stumbled
onto an idea that was a net positive at the time. Fast forward 200+ years and some
people still swear by it. Homeopathic remedies are so diluted that, by the time you
take them, there’s a good chance you’re just drinking really confident water. 30C,
a measure of dilution, means that the dilution is beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Avogadro&rsquo;s number</a>, meaning the likelihood of any original substance being left is basically zero.
Homeopathic practitioners give long, attentive consultations (because that&rsquo;s
actually what you&rsquo;re paying for), but that doesn’t make the sugar pills or vials
of water any more effective. If you feel better after taking them, congratulations:
you’ve unlocked the power of the placebo effect! Just make sure to keep your real
doctor in the loop, in case your chakras fail to fight off strep throat.</p>
<p>In my view, homeopathy in the 21st century turned into a bad idea, as it propagates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">magical thinking</a>. But would I be
open to magic if I had cancer and I&rsquo;ve already exhausted all other therapies? Maybe&hellip;
but probably no: I don&rsquo;t believe that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Effects">placebo effect</a>
requires a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cashectomy">cashectomy</a> to work.</p>
<p>Disagreements about ideas often stem from unrecognized contextual differences rather
than the concepts themselves. Taking time to align perspectives and clarify assumptions
before analyzing the idea itself prevents wasted time and emotional energy.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-spread-at-different-speeds">Ideas spread at different speeds</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a>, in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>, explains that scientific ideas don’t progress smoothly but through paradigm shifts—sudden overhauls
of existing frameworks. Most scientists work within an established paradigm, resisting
new ideas until anomalies accumulate and force a crisis. When evidence becomes
overwhelming, a new paradigm replaces the old one, often rapidly, though resistance
lingers. Kuhn argues that idea velocity depends on how much a new concept challenges
existing beliefs—some spread slowly (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">heliocentrism</a>),
while others (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">relativity</a>)
gain acceptance quickly when they solve pressing problems. Ultimately, scientific
revolutions happen not because opponents change their minds, but because they fade away,
making room for new thinkers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making
them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.&rdquo; &ndash; Thomas Kuhn</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio">Paul Virilio’s</a> theories on speed, technology,
and media are more relevant than ever in the digital age. He warned that as communication
accelerates, critical thinking is bypassed, leading to reactionary decisions and misinformation
spreading faster than truth. His idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93space_compression">dromology</a>—that
power belongs to those who control speed—explains how social media algorithms,
real-time news cycles, and AI-generated content now shape public perception. Virilio’s
“accident theory&quot; describes that every technological advancement comes with unintended
risks—just as social media was meant to connect people but has fueled division and
misinformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more speed increases, the faster freedom disappears.” &ndash; Paul Virilio</p></blockquote>
<p>Virilio is very clear that he sees speed as being antagonistic to the adoption of
good ideas. So one possible way of distinguishing a good idea from a bad one is
its age. The older an idea, the more time people have had to consider it critically
and therefore the more likely that the idea is a good idea. This is, of course,
assuming that the people who have propagated the idea had the right critical skills
and the right incentives to do so.</p>
<p>If a new idea comes along and is in conflict with an &ldquo;old good&rdquo; idea, then
it&rsquo;s not surprising that it will take some time to convince people to change their
minds; they may have built entire careers on the old good idea, and the new idea
might seem threatening and not entirely well thought through. Proponents
of the &ldquo;new good&rdquo; idea might also be somewhat overzealous in promoting it, which could
also result in more resistance than necessary. And that resistance might only fully
disappear with the death of the opponents, as Kuhn wrote. This can, for sure, be a
frustrating experience, but resistance itself is not the problem: it is a filter to
separate good ideas from bad ones. To a first order, it&rsquo;s not the time it takes that
matters most, but that error correction takes place: the &ldquo;new good&rdquo; idea is better
than the &ldquo;old good&rdquo; idea. These principles are embedded in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a> and Thomas Kuhn offered
contrasting views on how science progresses. Popper argued that science advances
through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>—the process
of making bold hypotheses and systematically testing them to eliminate errors. He
saw scientific progress as gradual and rational, driven by continuous refinement.
In contrast, Kuhn believed science moves through paradigm shifts—long periods of
stability followed by sudden revolutions when old theories collapse under mounting
anomalies. While Popper viewed scientists as rational truth-seekers, Kuhn highlighted
the social and psychological resistance to new ideas, showing how scientific
communities cling to outdated paradigms until a crisis forces change.</p>
<p>The good news is that either or both theories could apply to a given situation. what
matters most is understanding one&rsquo;s role in the process. Hemingway might have put it this way:</p>
<p>Know your place in the fight. When you push the new idea, expect the wall.
All good ideas hit it. Don&rsquo;t be an ass about it. Mockery makes enemies, not converts.
When you&rsquo;re the one fighting change, fight clean. Judge the idea on what it is,
not on what you might lose. A man thinking straight earns respect. A man
guarding his turf does not. If you believe, then act. Good ideas win in time.
Help them. You&rsquo;ll sleep better. Your way may differ. The outfit may have rules.
But a man chooses how he stands.</p>

Communication style (hidden shared context)
Musk&rsquo;s tweet</p>
<p>feelings, emotions, self-awareness</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is the context of an idea. This encompasses all
surrounding factors that shape its creation, meaning, and impact. This includes
timing, cultural values, social structures, intellectual frameworks, personal
experiences, situational needs, linguistic environments, pretty much everything
aside from the idea itself.</p>
<p>These contextual elements explain why ideas emerge
when they do, why they resonate with certain groups, and how they&rsquo;re interpreted
differently across settings. Understanding context reveals the hidden assumptions
within ideas and illuminates why identical concepts can produce vastly different
responses depending on when, where, and by whom they&rsquo;re presented. Context doesn&rsquo;t
just frame ideas—it fundamentally determines their value.</p>
<p>After understanding context, I evaluate each idea on merit and coherence with my
existing beliefs. I consider what adjustments accepting it might require, remain
alert to logical fallacies, and test for conceptual integrity. This process helps
me both assess ideas accurately and effectively communicate them to others.</p>
