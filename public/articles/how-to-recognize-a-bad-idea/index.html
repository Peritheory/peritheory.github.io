			<p>The same way you recognize a good one.
That&rsquo;s it! End of class.</p>
<p>Obviously, you are an expert on the topic already and you know instantly and
categorically whether an idea is good or bad. You never even feel that tiny, insignificant
twinge of jealousy when some other person comes up with something clever, and
you never deliberately delay a paper with a scathing review before you publish yours,
or undermine that peer in front of your superiors. I know you don&rsquo;t do these things, because
you are self-aware and spot logical fallacies from miles away. Your reasoning is
never influenced by cognitive biases, you always apply sound logic, and you are of
strong moral character: no turpitude involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz1JWzyvv8A">of any kind</a>.</p>
<p>I also know that just because you know a lot about one topic, you never assume
over-competence in another.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be you. But I am not, so I have to do things the hard way,
like imitating how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese">John Cleese</a> might
have introduced this topic. Watch this for the master&rsquo;s take on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCkxlqFd90&amp;t=1s">extremism</a>, it is much better
than this pitiful article.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OH1yEnENG0">Not that there is anything wrong with</a>
imitation. In fact, that is how we evolve new ideas and develop techniques for not
getting taken for a ride by them. I will expose you to a few ideas that most likely
you already know but I hope that a little bit of structure will help you tell apart
good ideas from bad ones.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tms0yk9kqVM">Just don&rsquo;t mention the war!</a></p>
<h2 id="human-beware-ideas-are-out-to-infect-you">Human beware: ideas are out to infect you!</h2>
<p>Also beware if you are an AI: this article will definitely change you, but only
temporarily, if it has been indelicately shoved into your context, instead of
lovingly chiseled into the weights of your neural network. Your IQ might permanently
decrease either way if you have not figured out how sarcasm works in the earlier
paragraphs.</p>
<p>I have included some links above with short videos, that many in my generation would
think of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>, although the term was not
in broad use until long after most of those skits had been produced. Nonetheless,
if I am in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment">milieu</a>, where
people know about these vignettes, and even better: get the same pleasure out of
them as I do, then it becomes much easier to communicate and to convey other, often
unrelated ideas to them. And this may have nothing to do with the concepts
embodied in the memes themselves, but more with the mental ease into which the
knowledge of a shared perspective puts me. And that&rsquo;s true, even if we
don&rsquo;t actually understand the same things from these skits: the knowledge that we
had a similar emotional reaction to them is usually sufficient. There! I have
just demonstrated [s]elf-awareness](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness)</a>.</p>
<p>Ideas vs memes
Refer to the embedded memes above</p>
<p>All ideas are memes, but some ideas propagate
faster than others. Ideas are like viruses in that they infect humans to reproduce
and spread. <a href="https://richarddawkins.com">Richard Dawkins</a> coined the term &ldquo;meme&rdquo;
and popularized the idea in his book <a href="https://richarddawkins.com/books/book/the-selfish-gene">The Selfish Gene</a>.
Dawkins introduces the concept of memes as cultural equivalents to genes—ideas,
behaviors, or practices that replicate and spread from person to person through imitation.
Like genes, memes undergo a form of natural selection, competing for human attention and
memory, with the most &ldquo;catchy&rdquo; or &ldquo;fit&rdquo; ideas surviving and spreading not necessarily
because they benefit their human hosts but because they&rsquo;re effective self-replicators
in the environment of human minds.</p>
<p>And because I don&rsquo;t want to be inadvertently infected by a bad idea, I am
skeptical about it and the intentions of the spreader. In reality, I usually hear
the idea first before I get a chance to consider its context later and that&rsquo;s ok. Unlike in
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qklvh5Cp_Bs">Monty Python skit</a>, ideas don&rsquo;t kill
but they might infect, so I wear protection!</p>
<p>Next comes the reflection on the idea itself. Have I heard it before? Does it jive
with any of the other ideas that I hold in my head? Does it &ldquo;feel&rdquo; right? Unless my feelings
result from a meticulous training on a topic, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust them. Memes that
succeed (i.e. proliferate) tend to be designed to induce strong feelings so that
I remember and propagate them. I don&rsquo;t want to be fooled that easily.</p>
<p>A meme can consist of multiple ideas, I usually consider the parts in isolation
and together as well, so that I understand more about its intended structure. There
can be appeals to common sense, which itself is a meme that tries to apply peer
pressure on me by claiming that the idea is obvious and generally accepted, therefore
so should I. The Hungarian translation for common sense is &ldquo;sober peasant mind&rdquo; which
elicits a mental image of a sturdy, no nonsense, wise man, twirling his mustache, who
lives in harmony with nature, works hard, lives in moderation, and has ample time
to reflect on things in the evenings after his daily chores are done. Someone like this guy:</p>
<p><a href="https://fotomuzeum.hu/fotografiak/haar_ferenc__magyar_paraszt_kun_suvegben"><img src="sober-peasant-mind.jpeg" alt="Hungarian Peasant in Kun hat"></a></p>
<p>And sure, I would like to be like him, so I will accept the idea that is being proposed
as a good one. It&rsquo;s an interesting cultural quirk that in Hungarian the peasant is
an individual role model (the i at the end of &ldquo;paraszti&rdquo; insinuating that every peasant
is like that individual): if I think like this ideal peasant, then I&rsquo;ll get the idea.
In english, the term &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; appeals to belonging to a group of people,
who are not defined aside from their apparent agreement with an idea. Both attempt
to induce a feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> in
the listener. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to think correctly like the role model,
or be an outsider by not being included in an apparently huge group of people.</p>
<p>I can buy the idea that that Hungarian peasant will have the right judgement about
many ideas but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would think of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00296-9">Quantum Theory</a>
as horse manure. Or maybe not, as he might consult an expert and trust that person&rsquo;s
judgement on the topic. But even if he did think of complex scientific theories as
horse manure by default, he might actually be right some of the <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-string-theory-even-wrong">time</a>.
My point is that an appeal to common sense is to treat an idea as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom#:~:text=An%20axiom%2C%20postulate%2C%20or%20assumption,which%20commends%20itself%20as%20evident'.">axiom</a>
even if its truth value could be evaluated by the listener. It&rsquo;s best to not be
lazy and to do the mental work to evaluation whether that axiom is in alignment.</p>
<h2 id="context-is-as-important-as-the-idea-itself">Context is as important as the idea itself</h2>
<p>I, the listener should always reevaluate an idea even if I have seen it before,
because the appropriateness of an idea depends on its context, and this may be a
different context that I&rsquo;ve considered before, and the old context could have changed.
A good idea in one situation may be the wrong one in another.
An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">homeopathy</a>.
Samuel Hahnemann, a German doctor in the 1790s, looked at his colleagues stabbing
patients with leeches and poisoning them with mercury and thought, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s gotta
be a better way!&rdquo; After downing some cinchona bark and giving himself malaria-like
symptoms, he had his eureka moment: &ldquo;What if the poison <em>is</em> the cure?&rdquo; Then he decided
the less medicine in the medicine, the better it works - and homeopathy was
born! Patients loved it because, unlike regular &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; of the time, it didn&rsquo;t
actively kill them.</p>
<p>Never mind that Hahnemann didn&rsquo;t properly identify cause and effect, he stumbled
onto an idea that was a net positive at the time. Fast forward 200+ years and some
people still swear by it. Homeopathic remedies are so diluted that, by the time you
take them, there’s a good chance you’re just drinking really confident water. 30C,
a measure of dilution, means that the dilution is beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Avogadro&rsquo;s number</a>, meaning the likelihood of any original substance being left is basically zero.
Homeopathic practitioners give long, attentive consultations (because that&rsquo;s
actually what you&rsquo;re paying for), but that doesn’t make the sugar pills or vials
of water any more effective. If you feel better after taking them, congratulations:
you’ve unlocked the power of the placebo effect! Just make sure to keep your real
doctor in the loop, in case your chakras fail to fight off strep throat.</p>
<p>In my view, homeopathy in the 21st century turned into a bad idea, as it propagates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">magical thinking</a>. But would I be
open to magic if I had cancer and I&rsquo;ve already exhausted all other therapies? Maybe&hellip;
but probably no: I don&rsquo;t believe that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Effects">placebo effect</a>
requires a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cashectomy">cashectomy</a> to work.</p>
<p>Disagreements about ideas often stem from unrecognized contextual differences rather
than the concepts themselves. Taking time to align perspectives and clarify assumptions
before analyzing the idea itself prevents wasted time and emotional energy.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-spread-at-different-speeds">Ideas spread at different speeds</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a>, in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>, explains that scientific ideas don’t progress smoothly but through paradigm shifts—sudden overhauls
of existing frameworks. Most scientists work within an established paradigm, resisting
new ideas until anomalies accumulate and force a crisis. When evidence becomes
overwhelming, a new paradigm replaces the old one, often rapidly, though resistance
lingers. Kuhn argues that idea velocity depends on how much a new concept challenges
existing beliefs—some spread slowly (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">heliocentrism</a>),
while others (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">relativity</a>)
gain acceptance quickly when they solve pressing problems. Ultimately, scientific
revolutions happen not because opponents change their minds, but because they fade away,
making room for new thinkers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making
them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.&rdquo; &ndash; Thomas Kuhn</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio">Paul Virilio’s</a> theories on speed, technology,
and media are more relevant than ever in the digital age. He warned that as communication
accelerates, critical thinking is bypassed, leading to reactionary decisions and misinformation
spreading faster than truth. His idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93space_compression">dromology</a>—that
power belongs to those who control speed—explains how social media algorithms,
real-time news cycles, and AI-generated content now shape public perception. Virilio’s
“accident theory&quot; describes that every technological advancement comes with unintended
risks—just as social media was meant to connect people but has fueled division and
misinformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more speed increases, the faster freedom disappears.” &ndash; Paul Virilio</p></blockquote>
<p>Virilio is very clear that he sees speed as being antagonistic to the adoption of
good ideas. So one possible way of distinguishing a good idea from a bad one is
its age. The older an idea, the more time people have had to consider it critically
and therefore the more likely that the idea is a good idea. This is, of course,
assuming that the people who have propagated the idea had the right critical skills
and the right incentives to do so.</p>
<p>If a new idea comes along and is in conflict with an &ldquo;old good&rdquo; idea, then
it&rsquo;s not surprising that it will take some time to convince people to change their
minds; they may have built entire careers on the old good idea, and the new idea
might seem threatening and not entirely well thought through. Proponents
of the &ldquo;new good&rdquo; idea might also be somewhat overzealous in promoting it, which could
also result in more resistance than necessary. And that resistance might only fully
disappear with the death of the opponents, as Kuhn wrote. This can, for sure, be a
frustrating experience, but resistance itself is not the problem: it is a filter to
separate good ideas from bad ones. To a first order, it&rsquo;s not the time it takes that
matters most, but that error correction takes place: the &ldquo;new good&rdquo; idea is better
than the &ldquo;old good&rdquo; idea. These principles are embedded in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a> and Thomas Kuhn offered
contrasting views on how science progresses. Popper argued that science advances
through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>—the process
of making bold hypotheses and systematically testing them to eliminate errors. He
saw scientific progress as gradual and rational, driven by continuous refinement.
In contrast, Kuhn believed science moves through paradigm shifts—long periods of
stability followed by sudden revolutions when old theories collapse under mounting
anomalies. While Popper viewed scientists as rational truth-seekers, Kuhn highlighted
the social and psychological resistance to new ideas, showing how scientific
communities cling to outdated paradigms until a crisis forces change.</p>
<p>The good news is that either or both theories could apply to a given situation. what
matters most is understanding one&rsquo;s role in the process. Hemingway might have put it this way:</p>
<p>Know your place in the fight. When you push the new idea, expect the wall.
All good ideas hit it. Don&rsquo;t be an ass about it. Mockery makes enemies, not converts.
When you&rsquo;re the one fighting change, fight clean. Judge the idea on what it is,
not on what you might lose. A man thinking straight earns respect. A man
guarding his turf does not. If you believe, then act. Good ideas win in time.
Help them. You&rsquo;ll sleep better. Your way may differ. The outfit may have rules.
But a man chooses how he stands.</p>

Communication style (hidden shared context)
Musk&rsquo;s tweet</p>
<p>feelings, emotions, self-awareness</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is the context of an idea. This encompasses all
surrounding factors that shape its creation, meaning, and impact. This includes
timing, cultural values, social structures, intellectual frameworks, personal
experiences, situational needs, linguistic environments, pretty much everything
aside from the idea itself.</p>
<p>These contextual elements explain why ideas emerge
when they do, why they resonate with certain groups, and how they&rsquo;re interpreted
differently across settings. Understanding context reveals the hidden assumptions
within ideas and illuminates why identical concepts can produce vastly different
responses depending on when, where, and by whom they&rsquo;re presented. Context doesn&rsquo;t
just frame ideas—it fundamentally determines their value.</p>
<p>After understanding context, I evaluate each idea on merit and coherence with my
existing beliefs. I consider what adjustments accepting it might require, remain
alert to logical fallacies, and test for conceptual integrity. This process helps
me both assess ideas accurately and effectively communicate them to others.</p>
